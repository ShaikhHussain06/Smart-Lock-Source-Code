# SmartLock: IoT-Enabled Access Control System

> **Abstract** : SmartLock is an IoT-powered door locking system that enables users to control and monitor door access remotely via a website. The system is built using an internet-connected microcontroller arduino with wifi module and integrates electronic locks with various authentication methods, including RFID module. 

Additionally, a dedicated web platform will be developed to store access logs, manage user permissions, and provide real-time security alerts. This system enhances security for homes, offices, and businesses, offering keyless entry, automation, and remote management for a smarter, safer environment.
